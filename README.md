# Hello World! I'm Vicky Gonsalves - Crafting Code, One Line at a Time

Welcome! In the big world of coding and tech, this is my space. I'm an experienced Full-Stack Developer, skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. I love building scalable solutions, promoting innovation, and supporting the open-source community.

## My Current Project: [Deno Rest](https://github.com/vicky-gonsalves/deno_rest)

Right now, I'm working on the [Deno Rest](https://github.com/vicky-gonsalves/deno_rest) project, an open-source framework aimed at making web app development easier. Using Deno, we're creating a strong framework to simplify building, testing, and deploying REST APIs.

Deno Rest is more than just codeâ€”it's a community of developers collaborating, learning, and shaping the future of web development. Join us as we explore new possibilities.
